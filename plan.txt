0. We scrape Google shopping for top results in "blue dress" and "green jacket".
- need image, product link, and title
- assign ID to each loveydove

1. User types in very broad item of what they want, e.g. "blue dress"
2. Matt does front end app for us.
- display top 20 images based on NLP (word intersection) and FC features

3. User selects at least 1 and up to 20 images.

4. Run similarity measure (NLP + cosine similarity for FC features)

5. Show top 20 results to user.

-------
If we have time,

Run neural net to train category (dress vs. top vs. jeans) so we can pass in a new image and it will tell us which category it is.
- clean the file string to get only the category (last underscore of the filename)
- pass image and change the last layer of resnet
